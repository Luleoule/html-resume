        <p>
            I love learning new things. More recently, I've had a deep interest in language learning, specifically Japanese. I'm also an avid musician. I play trumpet and bass and compose 
            frequently. I also go to the gym and work out 4 times a week, as I think keeping fit is extremely important. In the same vain, I love to cook since it helps keep me healthy
            and of course, it's nice to make great-tasting food.
